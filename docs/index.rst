NLDAS Data Tool
===============
The NLDAS Data Tool is a tool to facilitate downloading, visualizing, processing, analyzing, and sharing NLDAS forcing
data from NASA. NLDAS, North American Land Data Assimilation System, is a historical earth observation dataset based on
the LIS, Land Information System, land-surface model. The spatial resolution is 1/8 degree with a temporal resolution
of 1 hour.

The tool is a Tethys application with scripts for automated install and data downloads, several tools for data
visualization through maps and charts, and a REST API for programmatic access to the data. Tethys Platform is an
open-source software developed at Brigham Young University in the Hydroinformatics Lab. Tethys makes it easier to
develop and deploy web-apps for scientific data, especially geospatial and water resources related datasets.
`Read the Documentation for Tethys <http://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/stable/>`_ and visit the
